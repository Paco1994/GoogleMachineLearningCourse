# Exercise #2: Simulate 10 rolls of two dice.
#

# Create a dice simulation, which generates a 10x3 2-D tensor in which:

# Columns 1 and 2 each hold one throw of one six-sided die (with values 1â€“6).
# Column 3 holds the sum of Columns 1 and 2 on the same row.
# For example, the first row might have the following values:

# Column 1 holds 4
# Column 2 holds 3
# Column 3 holds 7
# You'll need to explore the TensorFlow documentation (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/array_ops) to solve this task.
